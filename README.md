# Channel Assignment of Heterogeneous Devices in Smart Home Environments

This repository is part of the paper: [Channel Assignment of Heterogeneous Devices in Smart Home Environments](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8717825), published at the IFIP/IEEE Symposium on Integrated Network and Service Management. This work presents an algorithm that minimizes interference in Smart Home (SH) environments through suitable wireless channels assignment. Experiments performed using the [OMNeT++ Network Simulator](https://omnetpp.org/) suggested that the proposed algorithm reduces the total interference and maximizes the packet delivery in comparison to existing approaches.
